		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>	Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest. Grew up in a small town loving the outdoors and taking care of the yard./n 
			I take pride in what I do and love doing it. When people walk by and ask if that's real, it makes me smile./n
			I use a California Trimmer and love the way it cuts and makes the lawn look like turf./n
			I typically cut every other day to keep the cut low.</p>
